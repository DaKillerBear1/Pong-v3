# Pong-v3
A basic Pong-clone used to practice my programming, help and ideas are appriciated!

This game is for educational purposes, I shall use this game to practice my programming.
In other words, all help is welcome! Big or small, not matter what. If you think you can
improve my code, please do! Just leave a description on what you did/improved/changed so
that I know what you did and can learn from it. If you happned to stop by and think you may
get some use out of my code (Maybe you're learning too?) then by all means take insperation!
